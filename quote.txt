Don't forget you are always on our minds.
Fortune not found? Abort, Retry, Ignore.
Help! I am being held prisoner in a fortune cookie factory.
It's about time I got out of that cookie.
Never forget a friend. Especially if he owes you.
Never wear your best pants when you go to fight for freedom.
Only listen to the fortune cookie; disregard all other fortune telling units.
It is a good day to have a good day.
All fortunes are wrong except this one.
Someone will invite you to a Karaoke party.
That wasn't chicken.
There is no mistake so great as that of being always right.
